title: Case Study - My work as Consultant Research Lead at Frisk Pty Ltd 
---

From September 2021 to April 2023 I worked part-time at Frisk, where I lead the data-science team. In this role, I wa responsible for identifying opportunities, conceptualising analytical architectures, improving Frisk’s analytical pipelines, creating/testing proof-of-concept work, and assisting the Engineering team in productionisation. 

With the data-science team, I developed proof-of-concept natural language processing (NLP) systems, image analysis, novel data parameterisation techniques, and chat systems for interacting with insights and data. We also performed a large amount of scoping work, identifying where Frisk could expand its product offering into new domains. In particular, adapting Frisk’s demonstration capabilities to suit specific industry problem definitions involved novel approaches to generate realistic data at scale.
