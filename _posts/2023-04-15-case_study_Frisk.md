title: Case Study - My work as Consultant Research Lead at Frisk Pty Ltd 
---

Since September 2021 I have worked part-time at Frisk, where I lead the data-science team. In this role, I am responsible for identifying opportunities, conceptualising analytical architectures, improving Friskâ€™s analytical pipelines, creating/testing proof-of-concept work, and assisting the Engineering team in productionisation. 

With the data-science team, I have developed proof-of-concept natural language processing (NLP) systems, image analysis, novel data parameterisation techniques, NLP-based interfaces. We have also done a large amount of scoping work, identifying where Frisk can expand its product offering into new domains.
