I believe in honesty, integrity and creativity – that we should explore problems with our clients and colleagues, instead of bringing preconceived ideas or standard solutions. I always endevour to act with the client’s interests at heart, taking care that the client’s wishes and goals are considered throughout the process. I want to earn clients’ and colleagues’ respect and repeat business by offering the best service available and solving difficult problems.

In both professional and personal life, I practise what I preach: cycling and using public transport where possible, minimising the embodied energy I consume, reducing energy consumption and ensuring it comes from sustainable sources.
