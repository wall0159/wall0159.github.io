I am Dr Angus Wallace, an expert data analyst, having more than 12 yearsâ€™ experience in analysis, modelling and interpretation. I bring a wealth of scientific and academic rigour, as well as much practical engineering experience. This means that conclusions are sound, thorough and methodical, having a basis in engineering and the sciences. My engineering experience means that I can offer practical recommendations from these solutions and can project-manage their implementation.

I believe that the goals of reducing environmental impact and increasing bottom line are mutually compatible, provided that a holistic and systemic approach is taken.

Because of my extensive modelling and analysis experience, I can offer unique and bespoke analyses, either as a consultant to your organisation or as a contractor to a consultant. My aim is to do great work and help people achieve great things.

### More Information

I can help you develop automated systems to manage data, form conclusions, create graphics and graphs, even automate reporting.
Please have a look at some of my articles to understand the type of work I do.
