Dr Angus Wallace

I love data and am an experienced data scientist and engineer, having more than 12 yearsâ€™ experience in building systems for data collection, transmission, and analysis. I have extensive experience in statistics, modelling (the full gamut, from simple linear models through to models employing complex machine-learning) and interpretation. I also have experience in the productionization of software systems, and enjoy working with other developers and system architects to devise solutions that play nicely with other existing systems or new systems in development. I bring a wealth of scientific and academic rigour, as well as strong practical engineering experience. This means that conclusions are sound, thorough and methodical, having a basis in engineering and the sciences.

Because of me extensive modelling and analysis experience, I can offer unique and bespoke analyses, either as a consultant to your organisation or as a contractor to a consultant.
