Angus loves data and is an expert data scientist, having more than 12 yearsâ€™ experience in analysis, statistics, modelling (the full gamut, from simple linear models through to models employing complex machine-learning) and interpretation. He also has experience in the productionization of software systems, and loves to work with other developers and system architects to devise solutions that play nicely with other existing systems or new systems in development. He brings a wealth of scientific and academic rigour, as well as strong practical engineering experience. This means that conclusions are sound, thorough and methodical, having a basis in engineering and the sciences.

Because of his extensive modelling and analysis experience, he can offer unique and bespoke analyses, either as a consultant to your organisation or as a contractor to a consultant. His aim is to do great work and help people achieve great things, rather than indulge in self-promotion.
